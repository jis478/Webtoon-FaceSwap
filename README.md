# Webtoon-FaceSwap

## Overview
I've trained [StyleMapGAN](https://github.com/naver-ai/StyleMapGAN) on a Webtoon image dataset from various Webtoon characters. Interestingly, even with limited number of training images (<1,000) and various characters (> 10) in the dataset, the model was successfully able to swap parts of two Webtoon faces with similar viewpoints. More results in a severe condition, such as face swapping for seemingly two different charactters, will be posted soon.
